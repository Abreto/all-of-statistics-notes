# 1 Probability
$$\newcommand{\PP}{\mathbb{P}}$$

## 1.2 Sample Spaces and Events

A sequence of sets $A_1, A_2, \dots$ is **monotone increasing** if
$A_1 \subset A_2 \subset \cdots$ and we define $\lim_{n \to \infty}A_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty{A_i}$.
A sequence of sets $A_1, A_2, \dots$ is **monotone decreasing** if
$A_1 \supset A_2 \supset \cdots$ and we define $\lim_{n \to \infty}A_n = \bigcap_{i=1}^\infty{A_i}$

## 1.3 Probability

**Theorem** (Continuity of Probabilities): If $A_n \to A$ then
$$\mathbb{P}(A_n) \to \mathbb{P}(A)$$
as $n \to \infty$.

## 1.4 Probability on Finite Sample Spaces
$$\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$$

## 1.5 Independent Events

Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint events, each with positive probability.
They can't be independent.
This follows since $\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)>0$ yet $\mathbb{P}(AB) = \mathbb{P}(\empty) = 0$.

Summary of Independence

1. $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if $\mathbb{P}(AB) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)$.

2. Independence is sometimes assumed and sometimes derived.

3. Disjoint events with positive probability are not independent.
